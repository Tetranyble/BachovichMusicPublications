His father was a dentist. He was the youngest of four children, with a brother, Robert (1907), and two sisters, Barbara (1902) and Beth (1909). He was educated locally, and studied, first, piano, and then, later, viola, from private teachers.\n\nHe began to compose as early as 1919, and after about 1922, composed steadily until his death. At a concert in 1927, conducted by composer Frank Bridge, he met Bridge, later showed him several of his compositions, and ultimately Bridge took him on as a private pupil. After two years at Gresham\'s School in Holt, Norfolk, he entered the Royal College of Music in London (1930) where he studied composition with John Ireland and piano with Arthur Benjamin. During his stay at the RCM he won several prizes for his compositions.\n\nHe completed a choral work, A Boy was Born, in 1933; at a rehearsal for a broadcast performance of the work by the BBC Singers, he met tenor Peter Pears, the beginning of a lifelong personal and professional relationship. (Many of Britten\'s solo songs, choral and operatic works feature the tenor voice, and Pears was the designated soloist at many of their premieres.)\n\nFrom about 1935 until the beginning of World War II, Britten did a great deal of composing for the GPO Film Unit, for BBC Radio, and for small, usually left-wing, theater groups in London. During this period he met and worked frequently with the poet W. H. Auden who provided texts for numerous songs as well as complete scripts for which Britten provided incidental music.\n\nIn the spring of 1939, Britten and Pears sailed for North America, eventually settling in Amityville, Long Island, NY, where they lived with Dr. and Mrs. Wm. Mayer and their family. In 1940 he worked with Auden on what would become his first opera, actually an operetta for high schools called Paul Bunyan, based on traditional American folk characters. However, on a trip to California in 1941, he read an article by E. M. Forster on the English poet George Crabbe, planting the seed for what would eventually be Britten\'s first opera, Peter Grimes. In 1942, Serge Koussevitzky became interested in Britten\'s music and performed the Sinfonia da Requiem with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Out of this association came the commission from the Koussevitzky Foundation (in memory of Koussevitzky\'s late wife Natalie) for the new opera, based on Crabbe\'s work The Borough. Britten and Pears worked on the scenario during their return voyage to England in March, 1942.\n\nDuring the early 40s, Britten produced a number of works, outstanding among them the Hymn to St. Cecilia, A Ceremony of Carols, Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, Serenade (for tenor, horn, and strings), Rejoice in the Lamb, and the Festival Te Deum. Peter Grimes, with a libretto by Montagu Slater, was complete in 1945 and had its premiere on June 7 of that year by the Sadler\'s Wells Opera Company. (Slightly over a year later, the work had its American premiere at the Boston Symphony\'s summer home at Tanglewood, under the baton of Leonard Bernstein.)\n\nOther operas appeared regularly in the ensuing years: The Rape of Lucretia (1946), Albert Herring (1947), The Little Sweep (1949), Billy Budd (1951) Gloriana (1953), The Turn of the Screw (1954), Noye\'s Fludde ((1957), A Midsummer Night\'s Dream (1960) Curlew River (1964), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1966), The Prodigal Son (1968) Owen Wingrave (1970) [for television], and finally Death in Venice (1973)','Britten.jpg'),(5,'James','Campbell','James Campbell has received worldwide recognition as a performer, pedagogue and author, and is a respected figure in the development of the contemporary percussion ensemble.

From classical concertos to jazz and rock & roll, from symphonic masterpieces to the most experimental compositions of living composers, Haas has championed, commissioned, unearthed and celebrated music for his instrument, becoming, as Ovation magazine hailed him, \"The Paganini of the timpani.\"\n\nHis concerts on the world\'s most prestigious musical stages and his ground-breaking recordings have delighted critics and listeners on both sides of the ocean. The New York Times wrote, \"Wherever one finds a percussion instrument waiting to be rubbed, shook, struck or strummed, [Haas] is probably nearby, ready to fulfill his duties with consummate expertise... he is a masterful young percussionist.\"\n\nHaas has garnered widespread praise and attention for his performances of Philip Glass\' Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra, a piece conceived by Haas and completed because of his quest to spotlight the timpani. The Concerto Fantasy features not only two timpanists, but also 14 timpani, all placed downstage in front of the orchestra. In 2000, Haas performed the world premiere of the piece with the American Symphony, and he has subsequently performed it at Carnegie Hall and in Phoenix, New Jersey, Baltimore, Pasadena, Long Beach (California), St. Louis and Mexico City. Haas also performed the European premiere with the BBC Symphony in London, the world premiere of a chamber orchestra version with the Iris Chamber Orchestra in Memphis, the Czechoslovakian premiere with the Prague Symphony Orchestra at the International Music Prague Spring Festival, the Norwegian premiere with the Bergen Philharmonic, and he will perform the Australian premiere with the Sydney Symphony and the Turkish premiere with the Istanbul Philharmonic.\n\nHaas\' successful efforts to expand the timpani repertoire have led him to commission and premiere more than 25 works by composers in addition to Philip Glass such as Stephen Albert, Marius Constant, Irwin Bazelon, Eric Ewazen, Thomas Hamilton, Robert Hall Lewis, Jean Piche, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Andrew Thomas, and many others.\n\nHaas also attracted plaudits when he built the world\'s largest timpani, which is nearly 6\' wide, nearly 4\' tall, and 70 inches in diameter, almost twice the size of the world\'s second-largest timpani (a 48-incher used by Amsterdam\'s Concertgebouw Orchestra). Haas discovered the kettle in an Aspen cow pasture. It had originally been used to manufacture Swiss cheese at the turn of the century and, remarkably, matched the exact size specifications of a timpani. Haas debuted a prototype of this unprecedented, incredible instrument at the Aspen Music Festival in August 2003, and it made its official premiere at the Percussive Arts Society\'s annual convention in Louisville, KY, in November 2003.\n\nAdditionally, Haas recently invented a process to improve the performance of crash cymbals that has been developed into a new instrument called \"The Master Series Anti-Lock Cymbal\" produced by Zildjian, the largest manufacturer of cymbals in the world.\n\nHaas\' recordings include the trail-blazing 18th Century Concertos for Timpani and Orchestra and Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing, both on Sunset Records. The latter was named for his jazz group and features innovative renderings of jazz compositions featuring \"hot timpani\" in front of a full jazz ensemble. His rediscovery of Duke Ellington\'s brilliant composition for jazz timpani, \"Tympaturbably Blue,\" is included on this recording, as are other jazz standards played on a set of ten kettledrums.\n\nDemonstrating a remarkable versatility as a musician, Haas has performed and recorded with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, played on the Grammy Award-winning recording Zappa\'s Universe, recorded with Aerosmith, Michael Bolton, Black Sabbath, and explored heavy metal with his rock group Clozshave.\n\nThe rarest of modern virtuosi, Haas embarked on his career as a solo timpanist by performing the only solo timpani recital ever presented at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1980. As an orchestral soloist, he made his debut with the New York Chamber Orchestra under Maxim Shostakovich and his European solo debut with the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. He made his French debut performing Andrez Panufnick\'s Concerto for Percussion, Timpani and Orchestra with the Orchestra de la Garde Republicaine. He was the soloist in the Druschetsky Concerto for Eight Timpani, Oboe and Orchestra with the Aspen Chamber Orchestra. He has also performed as a solo timpanist for the Distinguished Artists Recital Series at New York\'s 92nd Street \'Y\' and as a guest artist with the Lincoln Center Chamber Society, the Chamber Music at the \'Y\' Series, and the Newport Chamber Music Festival. He has championed new music by presenting adventuresome programming such as The Music of Frank Zappa, showcasing the music of Edgar Varese and Frank Zappa, under the auspices of Lincoln Center\'s Great Performers Series.\n\nHaas is the principal timpanist of the EOS Orchestra and the Aspen Chamber Orchestra and principal percussionist of the American Symphony Orchestra, as well as a member of the American Composers Orchestra. He performs with the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, New York Pops, and New Jersey Symphony and has performed and recorded with the New York Philharmonic, the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, the New York Chamber Orchestra, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and virtually every other New York-area performing arts organization.\n\nA graduate of Washington University in St. Louis, Haas received his Master\'s Degree from the Juilliard School as a student of Saul Goodman.

Novotney, born in California in 1960, has often looked toward Latin America for inspiration as a composer, performer and teacher. Rock-and-roll and Motown have been influences, too, along with jazz and symphonic repertoire. A Minute of News, which has earned its place in a four-volume set of solos called The Noble Snare, leaves Gramley with his hands full‹and occasionally empty. It requires him to zig and zag over the drum with sticks, timpani mallets, wire brushes, stick clicks, rim shots, and sometimes just his fingers and palms. “The combination of a heavy groove with light to heavy touches makes this piece loads of fun to play.” *** WILLIAM SUSMAN met Gramley a few years ago after a Silk Road concert in California. The composer remembers being “deeply impressed with his musicianship, virtuosity, and world music background”‹and Gramley was equally impressed with Susman, whom he describes as “a fabulous pianist who nonetheless really gets the marimba‹something not always true of composers who don’t play the instrument themselves.” Born in Chicago in 1960, Susman grew up learning jazz and classical piano before studying composition at the University of Illinois and Stanford. Perhaps his most important mentor was the composer Earle Brown, whose own “mobile form” was influenced by Calder’s sculpture. In 1985, Brown selected Susman, only 25, to be the youngest recipient of Harvard’s Fromm Music Foundation Commission, which goes to pathbreaking classical composers. Over the past decade, Susman has gained recognition for the scores he’s composed for documentary and independent films, including Oil on Ice (2004), but it’s his innovative classical work, widely performed in Europe and the U. S., that has won him the awards of organizations ranging from the Percussive Arts Society to ASCAP. Susman’s classical pieces, however emotive, often derive their shapes from such intellectual sources as the laws of fluid mechanics or the composer’s longheld fascination with Fibonacci’s 13th-century numerical sequence‹1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55‹in which each number equals the sum of the two coming before it. Marimba Montuño owes its harmony to the Fibonacci series and its pulse to Afro-Cuban rhythms, particularly the montuño, a particular ostinato (see Ganda Yina above) that’s repeated continually in the same pitch and voice. “I compose in small sections or chunks and then organize the sound into a fixed order,” says Susman. The end result is rhythmically supercharged‹a test of dexterity and speed for the marimbist. Gramley’s unflagging ability to play the rhythms simultaneously in both hands‹a relatively new feature of 4-mallet marimba technique and composition‹led Susman to dedicate the finished Marimba Montuño to the performer. But even before that Gramley had made the work his own. “I usually know within the first page if something I want is a keeper. Marimba Montuño is that kind of piece.” *** “I love to improvise,” says Gramley, whose musical niche offers frequent opportunities to do just that. “None of the solo repertoire in classical percussion predates the twentieth century,” he points out, “and it gives the performer a chance to keep inventing within a compositional framework. That’s something that attracted me to the work of PHILIP GLASS.” Gramley overcame some initial resistance to the composer‹who’s written only two works primarily for percussion‹through the influence of a friend “who would play the music of Philip Glass nonstop, 24/7.” Additional exposure turned indifference to intrigue‹and finally to a keen interest, especially in 1+1, a work that Glass composed in 1969, at the age of 32, midway on his journey from serialism through Indian music and onward to such historic works as Einstein on the Beach. “In western music,” Glass himself has observed, “harmony and melody are the dominant elements and rhythm tags along; it doesn’t really create a structure. In most nonwestern music, rhythmic structure is in fact the structure of the music.” Through this realization, the composer saw “the beginning of a new musical language” for himself. One of his early utterances in it was 1+1, a composition that was really, he’s explained, “more of a process than a piece of music. It described a way of notating music through what I began to call ‘additive process’‹taking a measure of music and adding one note to it and repeating it and then adding another note or subtracting a note.” The results, full of improvisational room for a performer like Gramley, can be captured in their entirety in just a few pages of notation. Gramley’s biggest challenge in playing 1+1 is to draw the listener in with a composition whose rhythmic melody is discernible through just two “cells” (Glass’s term). For his rendition of the work, Gramley decided to use two separate wooden tables as a kind of play on the title 1+1. He then attached an acoustic guitar’s contact microphone and ran 1+1 through an amp. He plays the entire piece with just the palms and fingertips of his own hands‹as well as a steady stream of imagination. “There’s nothing limiting about the score,” he marvels. “In fact, it makes you really open up your brain to the possibilities inherent in just two rhythms‹a kind of minimalism that you take to the max.” *** “I’m always on the lookout for new compositions that inspire me and that I can bring to a larger audience,” says Gramley. He found one in Danza del Fuego, originally written for classical guitar by JOHN LA BARBERA, who began his career during the 1970s, performing both solo and chamber music in Italy. The familiarity that LaBarbera gained with Mediterranean musical forms would influence the style he went on to develop as a studio musician in New York, where he has worked with an array of internationally-known artists. He has composed music for several Off-Broadway productions and folk operas, and is musical director of the Italian music-and-dance group “I Giulliari di Piazza.” La Barbera’s composing credits for film include Children of Fate (1993) and Cutting Loose (1996)‹each a winner of the Best Documentary prize at the Sundance Film Festival. “Guitar music tends to lend itself well to the marimba,” explains Gramley. “The ranges are similar, and so are the physical abilities of the guitarist and marimbist to play about the same number of notes at a time. By contrast, when piano music is transcribed for the instrument, the larger chordal writing has usually got to be edited down.” Gramley, who’s joined on this piece by Yousif Sheronick playing the doumbek, realized that his own transcription of Danza del Fuego would give him a chance to include a second work with a Spanish flavor on this globally-focused album, as well as the opportunity “to couple John La Barbera’s modern take on the guitar with Fernando Sor’s classical use of the instrument.” *** In the more than thirty works that she’s composed for the marimba, KEIKO ABE has vastly expanded the instrument’s literature, transforming what was once considered a primitive ‘folk instrument’ into a full-fledged concert one. Gramley first met Abe when he was a freshman at the University of Michigan in 1989. His professor Michael Udow had invited the composer to give a series of concerts throughout the state, and Gramley was excited to hear Abe perform her percussion-quintet piece “Conversation in the Forest“‹one of the early incarnations of Prism, which hadn’t been published at the time: “Keiko gave me a copy of her manuscript,” he recalls, “and I ran to the practice room to begin learning the piece.” Prism quickly became one of Gramley’s favorite marimba solos. Over the years Abe has arranged the work for marimba duet, marimba and percussion ensemble, and marimba with orchestra, but it was born as a two-mallet marimba solo that, like many of Abe’s compositions, sprang from improvisation. Gramley tries to keep this spontaneous quality in evidence when he performs the work himself. “The shifts and bends in the development of the melody reflect what happens to a ray of light as it meets a prism,” he explains. “Keiko’s fast, slicing melodic lines mimic the geometric figure’s refraction and dispersal of light, and her piece ends up achieving the same symmetry that the prism itself has. The work lies beautifully on the marimba. It’s a great piece of idiomatic writing that really speaks to me.” Gramley has performed with Abe off and on for more than a decade, most recently at the 2001 Percussive Arts Society International Convention in Nashville. “Keiko is a tiny woman,” he notes, “with a small sweet voice and mellow demeanor. That is, of course, until she starts to play. The sound really does come from deep inside her. I strive‹on Prism and other pieces‹to attain her raw power and emotional commitment to the sound of the marimba.” *** During Gramley’s days with Ethos, the group performed two of CHARLES GRIFFIN’s percussion quartets, one of them a commission (“The Persistence of Past Chemistries”). In 2001, with the aid of a Meet-the-Composer grant from New Music Marimba, Gramley got ready to begin collaborating with Griffin on a solo piece using multi-keyboard composition. Their first brainstorming session, destined to be rescheduled, was set for the morning of September 11 at Gramley’s studio in Manhattan. Charles Griffin, a native New Yorker whose choral and instrumental works have been performed throughout the U. S. and Europe, remembers how the 9/11 attacks “colored our moods and thoughts” every time he and Gramley met in the months that followed. During an early work session, while improvising with Gramley’s mallets on the marimba, the composer came up with an opening whose “mood reminded [him] a little of Randall Thompson’s choral work Alleluia,” a reverent request for peace written during the Second World War. Much of what Griffin wrote next would be marked by fragmentation and violence, but he remembers how, around January of 2002, the first snowfall of the season created one of those cityscapes that make New York “beautiful in a way it isn’t at any other time.” Some of the anger about September 11 was beginning to leave him, and the coda to his new composition came back around to the prayerful opening section in a way that may suggest conciliation to a listener. Visitations would not be fully finished until early 2004, shortly before Gramley recorded it. Griffin explains that when a composer assembles a unique combination of musical instruments for a single percussionist, “it’s as if he’s creating a brand new instrument.” In the complex Visitations, Griffin wrote for three keyboards: concert marimba, vibraphone and crotales (small, chromatic, antique Turkish bells). At the piece’s climax, a bass drum, cymbals and gongs are also heard. Griffin knew he had “this really amazing, just monster, player” in Joe Gramley, but he also knew, during their months of collaboration, that he was pushing the performer toward‹and sometimes even beyond‹his limits. Gramley remembers his own approach to the work becoming much more serious and deeply focused in the post-9/11 atmosphere, but he describes the mental and physical challenges with a kind of athletic relish. While pointing out how the keyboards require three different types of mallets (switched by the performer “when either hand has a moment off”), he also catalogs the different sorts of strokes he’s got to keep alternating: “very hard downstroke; quick upstroke; smooth, full downstroke. And don’t forget the pedal in the vibraphone! Visitations is such a balancing act that in order to perform it, I’ve got to take off my shoes. Otherwise I’ll slip off the pedal.” Memorization of Griffin’s music also proved a must: “There is no physical way for me to look at four different performance environments‹and sheet music to boot.” And yet, what pleases Gramley most‹the surest indicator of his successful collaboration with Griffin‹is how the emotional beauty of the piece never gets lost in the performing tour de force it requires. *** Gramley has yet to turn 35, but he’s seen a vast change in the available solo percussion repertoire between his earliest playing days and the present. As a boy learning the marimba and xylophone, he typically played music that had been transcribed‹not written originally‹for his instruments. These compositions–first intended for piano, violin and guitar –came to him as adaptations, but ones that carried their own opportunities for growth. “I learned to phrase in the manner of the original instrument,” he recalls with pleasure, “and to wonder why the guitar transferred especially well. Maybe it’s as simple as four mallets being not so different from five fingers.” He first began playing the D-major Estudio (No. 6) when he was a fifteen-year-old student at Interlochen. “The piece is so plainly beautiful and lyrical that it has stuck with me to this day.” The composer, FERNANDO SOR (1778-1839), thrived as both a performer and a composer after leaving his native Spain for political exile. His guitar works, full of challenging key signatures, also came to include Estudio No. 17, which Gramley performs here along with No. 6. “These two ‘estudios’ are just that‹studies,” he explains. “Each sets out to achieve a technical goal on the guitar. And yet they can stand, stylishly, on their own musical merits.” With the work of Fernando Sor, Gramley and this CD come full circle, home to the performer’s earliest days and to some of the music that started him on his global-percussive journey.

On their first CD titled “Like Minds” the duo blends classical and jazz fusion music into a highly creative and exciting recording. Highlights from the CD include Synchronicity’s own transcription of the first part of Igor Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring”. A tour de force for percussion and piano, “The Rite” has become a signature piece for the duo. Also on the CD is a transcription of Claude Debussy’s “The Sunken Cathedral”. Based on the myth of a mystical island that rises and then sinks back into the sea, the duos’ version reflects all the drama and color and then some of Debussy’s fantastic original piano solo. The duo really gets to stretch their jazz fusion chops on John Psathas’ “Drum Dances”; an extremely challenging duet between drumset/glockenspiel and piano that pushes the technical limits of each instrument. Pianist Garah Landes also composed three pieces for the CD. “The Rain”, composed for talented soprano Cynthia Wuco and based on the poetry of Robert Creeley is smoky and meditative. “Last Look”, written after the composer had a vivid dream about his recently departed father passing on to a happier and more beautiful place takes you through his journey. And finally, “Plead the Fifth”, an exciting and powerful study in fusion tinged melodies and complex odd meters. Double bassist Ian Bracchitta joins the duo on “The Rain” and “Last Look”. Throughout the entire CD, percussionist Gregory Landes makes good use of the wide variety of instruments at his disposal. Mr. Landes is up to the task of negotiating the extremely difficult multi-percussion demands of “The Rite of Spring” transcription as well as navigating through the highly demanding drumset part of the “Drum Dances”.

For these reasons, Beall found Metheny’s compositions a natural fit for percussion arranging and decided to arrange one of his songs for a Drum and Bugle Corps competition. Therefore, the Pat Metheny Suite found its beginnings in 2003 with an arrangement based on The Heat of the Day, which the Carolina Crown Percussion Ensemble performed and went on to win the D.C.I. percussion ensemble competition. It then seemed natural to expand the idea of Metheny for percussion ensemble, so Beall picked two of his favorite Metheny tunes, First Circle and Letter from Home, and created a 3-movement suite for an ensemble of 10 percussionists. First Circle and Letter from Home are more traditionally arranged, whereas The Heat of the Day features several original passages in addition to his arrangement of Metheny’s piece.',45.00,NULL,NULL),('0619',3,NULL,'duet','marimba','voice','Song of \'Almah for marimba and soprano','19-20 min.','includes two scores','\"Strong, honest, and musically sincere\" - Gordon Stout\n\n\"Beall has found the key to composing for marimba and soprano\" - PAS News\n\nThe text is taken from the Old Testament book, Song of Solomon, written c. 945 BC. King Solomon, known for writing over 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs, called this composition his Shir Hashirim – his most exquisite “Song of all Songs.” It is an incomparable celebration of romantic love in all aspects.\n\nIn the entirety of Solomon’s 700 marriages and 300 additional maid-servant relationships, his search for true love led him to one ‘almah, one young girl, one maiden, who captured his heart like no other. She is called a Shulamite, from the city of Shunem which was located southwest of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. The residents were descendents of Issachar, one of Jacob’s twelve sons, and they were known for their strength, humility, and desire to serve unconditionally.\n\nFrom the Song of Solomon we learn that ‘Almah grew up with harsh brothers who forced her to labor in her family’s vineyards. She viewed herself as a common girl, like the common meadow flowers “a rose of Sharon” and “a lily of the valleys.” Yet, ‘Almah’s life changed forever when the most powerful ruler known to man fell deeply in love with her, making her his only beloved. Like a shepherd, Solomon gave her rest. Like an oasis, he gave her water and safety. Like an apple tree in the forest, he stood out broadly among men. Such are the beginning images in the Song that describe her new life with the king.\n\nIn Hebrew, \'Almah means “young girl, maiden, or damsel”.

During one of my frequent cat-naps, I wondered what it would be like to be a calico cat and have a calico dream.

We sneak and skulk, slither and slink; slowly, carefully, around the corners, through the depths, below the caverns and into the abyss.

Yet in that world an ancient complex scheme prevails: societal principles, beliefs, and norms organized, so deeply ingrained that soon the new life is squeezed into conforming to the structure. The Machine. Individually its components are worthy: obey rules, honor thy parents, respect mankind, go to school, get a higher education, graduate, become a success, make lots of money, make friends, support good causes, find true love, work hard, never give up, experience life to its fullest. Its existence fosters order and equilibrium. Yet a high price is paid as the System smothers individuality and creativity. If you don’t conform, then you’re often discarded by society. Can we break away before the Machine traps us forever? Can we find deliverance before our personal freedoms vanish? Hope, courage, and confidence must be aroused to challenge the unrelenting System.

A self-taught guitarist and composer, Zappa began his career in the late 1960\'s joining the Mothers, a California band known for combining creative pop and jazz melodies with witty, satirical lyrics. In a very short time, Zappa became famous for a compositional style that included avant-garde, rock, jazz fusion, and contemporary classical. In 1986, he released the album Jazz From Hell, composed and performed by Zappa primarily on a digital synclavier. At this point in his career, Zappa felt that human beings were incapable of executing the complex and virtuosic music that he wished to compose. This piece, G-Spot Tornado, is from the album Jazz From Hell. In the early 1990\'s, Frank Zappa was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and died on December 4, 1993. He has proved to be one of the most prolific musicians ever, releasing over 60 albums during his lifetime.

First, of course, the shortage of marimba/cello duets in the world was just too much! And secondly, the composer had many specific requests to create a Song of ‘Almah instrumental version from friends and colleagues. Therefore, in order to tell the story, instrumentally, ‘Almah needed to be an instrument of beauty and expression, soothing in nature, that would compliment these aspects of the marimba. Needless to say, Beall found the cello to be this perfect fit, as it also seemed the most similar instrument to the human voice in range and emotion.\n\nThe text is taken from the Old Testament book, Song of Solomon, written c. 945 BC. King Solomon, known for writing over 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs, called this composition his Shir Hashirim – his most exquisite “Song of all Songs.” It is an incomparable celebration of romantic love in all aspects.\n\nIn the entirety of Solomon’s 700 marriages and 300 additional maid-servant relationships, his search for true love led him to one ‘almah, one young girl, one maiden, who captured his heart like no other. She is called a Shulamite, from the city of Shunem which was located southwest of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. The residents were descendents of Issachar, one of Jacob’s twelve sons, and they were known for their strength, humility, and desire to serve unconditionally.\n\nFrom the Song of Solomon we learn that ‘Almah grew up with harsh brothers who forced her to labor in her family’s vineyards. She viewed herself as a common girl, like the common meadow flowers “a rose of Sharon” and “a lily of the valleys.” Yet, ‘Almah’s life changed forever when the most powerful ruler known to man fell deeply in love with her, making her his only beloved. Like a shepherd, Solomon gave her rest. Like an oasis, he gave her water and safety. Like an apple tree in the forest, he stood out broadly among men. Such are the beginning images in the Song that describe her new life with the king.\n\nIn Hebrew, \'Almah means “young girl, maiden, or damsel”. A variation on the word is the Hebrew musical term \'alamoth, which can be translated \"soprano.\" So the Song of ‘Almah is the composer’s duet for marimba and \'alamoth.

Sanlúcar was born in the southwest port of Andalucia, Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Since the 1960s, he became one of the leading advocates in promoting and developing the Flamenco genre.

Originally, Corrida Real is written for 1 guitar, however the virtuosic technique makes it hard to believe that Sanlúcar is playing this piece by solo. His performance of Corrida Real brings the excitement and pleasures of the Flamenco rhythm and melodic lines. Generally, many Flamenco guitar works were not written into scores, and Corrida Real is no exception. As with the other Sanlúcar work in this album, Amor en Primavera, the arrangement of Corrida Real for the Marimba combines the unique coloring, rhythm and images of light and dark of this work with the artistic charms of the Marimba.\n\nMy Favorite Things \n(Richard Rodgers, transcribed by Mayumi Sekizawa)\nA widely well known song from the movie Sound of Music.

Unlike most keyboard versions of an orchestral work, it was not an arrangement of the full score. It existed before the orchestral score had been written out, although details of the instrumentation had already been clear in Holst’s mind from the moment he began sketching the work. The reason that he needed a keyboard version on paper was that he suffered from neuritis in his right arm, and this often prevented him from playing over his sketches while he was composing.\n\nHe was able to ask two of his colleagues on the music staff of St. Paul’s Girls’ School, Vally Lasker and Nora Day, to play his two-piano version to him on Saturday mornings in his sound-proof music room at the school. These two friends were his chief amanuenses. When the time came for them to help him write out the full score they were able to follow the details of instrumentation which they had written from his dictation in the margins of the keyboard manuscripts they had been playing from. (The manuscripts, autograph and partly autograph, are in the British Library Add. MS 57811: the Royal College of Music Parry Room Library MS 4556-61: and the Royal Academy of Music MS 303.)\n\nThe seven movements of this two-piano version were first published separately in 1949-51, and most have been out of print for some time. They are now reissued complete in one volume, providing a welcome opportunity for pianists to discover the music for themselves in performance.\n\nPercussion Notes\nThe percussion parts for th is arrangement of The Planets, are derived from Holst’s orchestral version, and my own imagination. It is to be used in conjunction with Holst’s complete original two-piano score. All of the original orchestrated percussion parts have been included along with additional percussion scoring which imitates and colors what is heard in the later orchestrated version.

The second movement is the adagio and features a lyrical melody in shifting meters over a chorus of suspended cymbals playing soft rolls. The third movement is a high energy finale with a chromatic theme that darts, swoops and dives high above an accompaniment that boils over the stage. The ending is one that won\'t soon be forgotten.

In hindsight I see that the piece represents an attempt to include the mystery of hushed, ceremonial sounds with the exuberance of trance and dance traditions. The mechanics of the piece are as follows: virtually all the harmony is built around an Indian raga whose signature intervals are a flatted second, fifth, and sixth, and a major seventh. A great deal of focus rests on the harmonic hinge created by the major seventh, root, and minor second. Rhythmically the piece owes a debt to traditions from India and W. Africa, suffused with American vernacular. Emphasis is placed on lines in the mallets that pick up off one another, crisscrossing contrapuntally.

King Solomon, known for writing over 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs, called this composition his Shir Hashirim – his most exquisite “Song of all Songs.” It is an incomparable celebration of romantic love in all aspects.\n\nIn the entirety of Solomon’s 700 marriages and 300 additional maid-servant relationships, his search for true love led him to one ‘almah, one young girl, one maiden, who captured his heart like no other. She is called a Shulamite, from the city of Shunem which was located southwest of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. The residents were descendents of Issachar, one of Jacob’s twelve sons, and they were known for their strength, humility, and desire to serve unconditionally.\n\nFrom the Song of Solomon we learn that ‘Almah grew up with harsh brothers who forced her to labor in her family’s vineyards. She viewed herself as a common girl, like the common meadow flowers “a rose of Sharon” and “a lily of the valleys.” Yet, ‘Almah’s life changed forever when the most powerful ruler known to man fell deeply in love with her, making her his only beloved. Like a shepherd, Solomon gave her rest. Like an oasis, he gave her water and safety. Like an apple tree in the forest, he stood out broadly among men. Such are the beginning images in the Song that describe her new life with the king.\n\nIn Hebrew, \'Almah means “young girl, maiden, or damsel”. A variation on the word is the Hebrew musical term \'alamoth, which can be translated \"soprano.\" So the Song of ‘Almah is the composer’s duet for marimba and \'alamoth. It was commissioned by Charles Beall, who also chose the Song of Solomon as the text.

By transposing the key of the piece from its original D major to C major and transposing the melody down an octave, Wilhelmj was able to play the piece on only one string of his violin, the G string. Later, a spurious story was put about that the melody was always intended to be played on the G string alone. Andrew Beall adapted this timeless work for solo marimba almost 300 years later and kept Wilhelmj\'s transposition intact.',10.00,NULL,NULL),('0742',93,NULL,'solo','snare',NULL,'March for snare drum and kick drum (1 player)','1:30 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0743',94,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Expansive Horizons for solo marimba','8 min.',NULL,'Expansive Horizons is a virtuosic and musically challenging work for solo marimba.

The second movement “Soaring” is a perpetually moving expansion of the opening music. In this movement there are four very large sections: “Allegro passionato” characterized by tense syncopations; “Andante maestoso” a softer, fluid, section; “Moderato tranquilio” a gentle section of chordal arpeggios; and, after a brief recapitulation of the movement’s opening, a flourishing coda appropriately marked “Allegro meteorico.”\n\nFor more information about this piece please visit: www.danieltemkincomposer.com',15.00,NULL,NULL),('0745',94,NULL,'quartet',NULL,NULL,'Wanderings for percussion quartet','5:30 min.','includes 4 parts and score','For more information about this piece please visit: www.danieltemkincomposer.com',30.00,NULL,NULL),('0749',8,NULL,'solo','vibes',NULL,'Fantasia','3 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0750',8,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Duoble Me','4 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0751',8,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Mostra del Cinema','3:20 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0752',8,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Exotic Dream','5 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0753',8,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Marimba Gitana','7:30 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0754',8,NULL,'solo','vibes',NULL,'Lounge','4 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0755',8,NULL,'duet','vibes','piano','Tango Grandes for vibraphone and piano','4 min.','includes vibraphone part and score',NULL,20.00,NULL,NULL),('0756',8,NULL,'solo','vibes',NULL,'Goodbye Grandpa','3 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0757',8,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Zone','6:20 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0758',8,NULL,'solo','snare',NULL,'Variations on an Idea for solo snare drum','3:20 min.',NULL,NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0759',41,'Stravinsky','solo','multi',NULL,'L\'Histoire du Soldat (Re-notated for easier reading)','30 min.','includes percussion part only',NULL,25.00,NULL,NULL),('0760',90,'Puccini','ensemble',NULL,NULL,'Nessun Dorma for percussion ensemble (13 or 14 players)','5 min.','includes 14 parts and score','Instrumentation:\nGlockenspiel, Vibraphone (2), Xylophone, Chimes, 4 or 5 Marimbas (2 or 3- 4.3 octaves, 2- 4.5 octaves), Timpani (4), Suspended Cymbal, Piatti, Triangle, Bass Drum, Gong.\nMarimba 1, 2, and 5 should use 4.3 octave marimbas.

So I wrote it freely, deciding to simply explore this palindromic idea in different ways instead of letting it govern the entire work. Thus the piece has no predetermined form, rather an episodic feeling with short motives and longer ideas returning and developing. Sometimes a palindrome takes up only one bar, whereas much longer sections will appear flipped.

In addition to steady grooves, the second movement contains many subdivisions of the main pattern as well as cross rhythms – typical of African and Latin American-based music. The third movement begins with a textural approach but quickly moves towards a Latin jazz concept with written and improvised solos for drum set.

The second movement, titled “War”, shows the struggle to cope with this loss. The timpani kicks off the movement and immediately draws attention to the odd meter, which captures the uncertainty of this emotion. The chime enters towards the end of the movement, establishing a more stable two beat feel with the heart beat of the bass drum. This starts the third movement, which is titled “Triumph”. Esoteric sounds surrounding the repetitive pattern in the bells and vibes helps to add to the sense of lifting from the earlier depiction of “war”.

This juxtaposition of what is essentially the simultaneous performance of 3/4 and 6/8 is found in the interesting, dance-like opening measures played pizzicato in the original, which Gerhart imitates on the marimba by using dead strokes. Gerhart has retained Ravel\'s original tempo and performance markings. Mallet choice is left to the performer; the use of multiple mallets facilitates performance of the second and third marimba parts. Contributions from the arranger include the addition of rolls, the use of dead strokes, the enharmonic alteration of E sharps and C flats to F and B for ease of reading, and the use of treble and bass clefs in place of the alto clef in the original\'s viola part.

My two-mallet technical studies often involved improvised exercises that were enjoyable and addressed my own personal strengths and weaknesses. I found that \"cookie cutter\" exercises were not nearly as effective as those directly aimed at my playing. In the end, musicians should take note that everyone has their own unique profile. The Additive Method offers the percussionist the opportunity to create a personal practice routine which can evolve along with their individual musical needs.\n\nGene Koshinski\nHartford, Connecticut (2007)',20.00,'Additive_Method.jpg',NULL),('0831',82,'Chopin','duet','marimba','vibes','Prelude #4 for marimba and vibraphone','2 min.','includes 2 parts and score',NULL,10.00,NULL,NULL),('0832',82,NULL,'duet','multi','perc','Pascal\'s Motor Rhythms for percussion duet','3:30 min.','includes 2 parts and score','In mathematics, Pascal\'s triangle is used to determine coefficients when expanding binomial equations.

Written for a recital of music based on Bach’s influence, I wrote my solo piece for three different types of guiros. Since I wasn’t dealing with real pitches, I created an “implied imaginary melody”, heard in the opening bars as if it was the statement of a fugue. My use of the title, literally meaning “as above”, is this melody and all the continuous references back to it throughout the piece. The material develops first by the use of a rhythmic counterpoint of the original subject, which is not only based on the imaginary “melody”, but is also taken from the influence of each individual guiro sound. In particular, the playing techniques lend itself naturally to the timbre of each instrument, eventually unfolding as part of my “pitch structure”. Rather than a set of variations, the “melody” and “countermelodies” are developed through the alternation between sections. This constant alternation creates tension and new sonorities to a basically monophonic texture. The specific lengths of each section are left up to the performer, similar to the dynamics in Bach’s music. Carefully balanced with the improvisatory manner of the piece, this creates an illusion of interpretive freedom with a real sense of virtuosity.',25.00,'come-sopra-cover.jpeg',NULL),('0943',15,NULL,'orchestra',NULL,NULL,'Strophe for vibraphone and string quartet','15 min.','includes 5 parts and score','\"Strophe\", was commissioned by Colin Currie, for Vibraphone and the Miro String Quartet for their 2013 US tour. Since Colin asked me to specifically write for vibraphone, I wanted to base the piece on his playing of course, and the simple idea of all material stemming from the vibraphone itself. The most basic characteristic of the instrument is its ability to resonate, and this can be manipulated by the use of the sustain pedal, similar to that of a piano. The other element and probably the most important for me in this piece, was the overtone frequencies of the metal bars. Before I started though, I had to consider the problem that has come to be expected by all percussionists - no two instruments are ever the same. This can be seen as an issue for the composer, but it’s what keeps percussionists unique in their approach to performance. When dealing with metal percussion instruments, the tunings are always different from one instrument to the next because of the alloy and chemical makeup. But there are some overtones that are generally consistent on all instruments. I wrote my piece on two instruments-one older with bars made of bronze and steel and a modern instrument made of hard, light aluminum alloy. Generally I prefer the older instruments because the fundamental pitch is stronger and the first overtone all vibes are tuned to (fundamental two octaves higher) helps the technique of playing harmonics. All of my pitch material comes from the overtones of the metal bars, which ring differently depending on the register, type of mallet, and dynamic played. When played in succession, as in the opening lowest F natural, the overtones are most rich and obvious. The overtones I based my structures on are, the 8th (F two octaves higher), 10th (A), 15th (E), and 17th (F#). Since I was expanding the pitches of the vibes above the instrument with the help of the quartet, I also wanted to extend below. To do this I created a series of “undertones”, by inverting the overtone pitches with the F natural as a center pivot.\n\nThe title “Strophe” is taken from the original Greek strophi (stro-fee), meaning the act of turning, to bend, to twist. With the induction of overtone frequencies in combination with the quartet, there is always a sense of friction, which gives rise to motion. The piece is in an arch form in three short movements. In the first movement the vibes initiate all activity, while the quartet reacts, pressing up against and resisting the motion of all elements. As if two separate forces, they constantly rub right up against each other, moving over and through surfaces, expanding above and below the range of the vibraphone. The second movement is an interlude, in static focus on the natural vibrations and resonance of the metal bars. The quartet mimics the vibrations in slow motion with the use of changing tremolo speeds- as if inside the bars. Then through the use of colored bow changes, vibrato speeds and microtonal tunings, they create a type of viscous friction moving relative to one another, only to change paths when coming into contact with the bowed vibes. In the third movement all material comes from the quartet, but already influenced by the vibes by this point, they translate the higher close frequencies into octatonic scales. This fast and frantic rondo-like movement, is at first echoed by the vibraphones use of the vibrato motor at different speeds and by the end of the piece, this resonance eventually takes over. The frictional force and contact between the elements induces constant change, transforming into a new stable and unstable form always emerging.',50.00,NULL,NULL),('0944',13,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Prelude Nuevo for two-mallet marimba solo','4 min.',NULL,NULL,15.00,NULL,NULL),('0945',13,NULL,'solo','marimba',NULL,'Caleidoscopio for two-mallet marimba solo','4 min.',NULL,NULL,15.00,NULL,NULL),('0946',93,NULL,'solo','multi',NULL,'To Varese for multi-percussion solo','3:30 min.',NULL,'This piece employs French rudimental concepts in a multi-drum setup.
